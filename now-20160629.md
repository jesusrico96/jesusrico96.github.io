I'm starting a learning process to improve in Front-end development. I have created a <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">Kanban</a> to organize myself and I will write the process in my <a href="http://cristinafsanz.github.io/projects/blog/">blog</a>. All the resources that I will use in the project will be available in GitHub in a collaborative site like <a href="https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources/blob/master/learn_to_program.md">Learn to program resources WomenWhoCode</a>.

After finding some great illustrators like <a href="https://twitter.com/frannerd">Frannerd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/WheresMyBubble">Debbie Tung</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/liams_art">Liam O'Farrell</a>, I have the "urge" to learn illustration, so I will start with a <a href="http://www.thehobbymaker.com/curso/introduccion-a-la-acuarela-creativa-parte-2/">introduction course</a> in Madrid with watercolors.
