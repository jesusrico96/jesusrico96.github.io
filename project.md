    When I realized that I wanted to learn web design, I decided to do a 6 months course in Madrid. As a final project in this course, I did a web page for a friend about psychology and teenagers. This is the page that I did, using HTML5, CSS and JQuery.

    <p>After that, I discovered Bootstrap and I wanted to create another web page using this framework. Currently I live in Madrid and I like to go for a walk in the city and discover new places, so I had the idea to take photographs to some nice buildings and put them together in a web page. This is the result.</p>
    <p>P.S. After learning more front-end development, I discovered that <b>Bootstrap is not a good way to do web design</b>. For more information, see these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZkhptFfhwNEmp3k7BKgRPk4b0eNck__nWWjJldxaTk/edit#slide=id.p4">slides</a>.</p>

    When I discovered GitHub pages and Jekyll blogs, I thought that a good way to learn it would be to reuse a Jekyll theme for a nice website. As my father wanted to have a place with all his paintings, this was a good opportunity to practise the customization of Jekyll themes. This is the Jekyll theme that I used:
