On the week of the 28th of June I had the opportunity of presenting my work at the XII CNIT, one of the most relevant events in my field in Spain.

The oral communication I presented was titled __An experimental study on poultry industry-derived solid biofuels__, while the poster I designed conveyed the most recent advancements in Activated carbon research performed in our lab.
