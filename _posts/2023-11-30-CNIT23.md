Closing 2023 in the middle of a rush to deliver the final version of my Thesis's manuscript, I had the chance to present some of the work carried out by our lab at the 13th National and 4th [International Conference in Engineering Thermodynamics](https://www.fue.uji.es/13cnit) that took place in Castell√≥ de la Plana. In this case I had the poster that you can see in the picture that accompanies this post, as well as an oral presentation titled __Study on the reproducibility of tests of a novel PM and VOC abatement system__.

While my oral presentation versed on my Thesis's work, the poster was created thanks to the inmense work carried out by the next generation of the lab, my colleague Amanda Franco. It's really amazing to see that the torch will be passed on to such talented people!
