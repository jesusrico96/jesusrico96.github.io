As my PhD is about to enter its third (and hopefully final!) year, I had the opportunity to share my work at the [Cambridge Particle Meeting](https://cambridgeparticlemeeting.org/), wihth the oral presentation titled __Understanding PM: Generation, capture and automatic classification of combustion PM emission__.

Understanding pollutants and proposing solutions to control them has been a major part of my research so far, and this Meeting is one of the best places to learn the state of the art and new ideas on the topic. 

From new approaches to emissions in naval engines to promising advances in data science, simulation and experimentation, I for sure have a lot to learn, but the outlook looks promising!
