<p>After organizing a little and analyze what I want to learn to improve in Front-end development, it comes a question to my mind: How to get time for this? This learning process is like a side project, so I have researched in Internet to get some ideas.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Avoid distractions: find time to work in the project when there are no distractions.</li>
      <li>Create consistency in your weekly calender: create a “Learning evening”.</li>
      <li>Be a passenger: use commute to learn something.</li>
      <li>Learn to say no to things that you don’t really want to: priorization is the key to success.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>The time you set aside to work on your side project has to come from somewhere: less TV, less time for hobbies, …</li>
      <li>Get up an hour earlier</li>
      <li>Put it in your calendar: or in my case in the kanban board</li>
      <li>Make it regular: I can choose 2 days in the week to do the side project, the same as I go to pilates twice a week.</li>
      <li>Make a commitment: I spoke about the talk I submitted to a group of people, so I have a deadline for the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
