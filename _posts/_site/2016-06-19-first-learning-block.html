<p>After organizing the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">learning Front-end development project</a>, I am going to start learning about Preprocessors (Sass for CSS and Jade or HAML for HTML), Postprocessors (PostCSS) and automatic workflow (with Gulp or Grunt):</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/first_learning_block.jpg" alt="First learning block" /></p>

<p>After learning this block I will apply the new concepts creating a web design, uploading the code in GitHub and sharing the results in the blog.</p>

<p>Do you know free online resources for all of this? Right now I am focus on the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-sass">Learn Sass course</a> from Codecademy, but I will add all the resources in the Taiga Kanban and in the blog while I am learning.</p>

<p>Wish me luck :)</p>
