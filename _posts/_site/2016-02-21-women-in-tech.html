<p>One month ago I went to the first meeting of a new Meetup group in Madrid: “Ada Code Group”, for women developers that want to improve their skills and spread their knowledge. In that meeting, a girl, Laura Morillo,  who works with different organizations to make visible the role of women in tech, told us about a new event, “Women Techmakers Madrid 2016” and she encourages us to present a talk in the Call for Papers. I didn’t do any talk until now, but I presented one, about creating a Portfolio with Jekyll and Github Pages.</p>

<p>Although I wasn’t selected to do a talk, I was invited to an event to practise our skills making a speech in front of an audience.
The event took place today and it was for free, although is was done for professional people and in a Sunday morning. The 2 girls that help us with our speech were from an organization called “Materia prima” and they did it very well. As they spoke, I said to myself that I want to be like them, spoking in front of people with confidence, knowledge and enjoying the time.</p>

<p>They told us about centralizing in a main idea that we want the people to retain. We can do a brainstorming first to get all ideas, but after that we should focus in the main idea to do our speech. We have to think about the context of the conference, when we are going to speak and the person that does the talk before us.</p>

<p>Another important aspect is that people use to listen more at the beginning and at the end, so we have to motivate them to listen to us from the very beginning and try to maintain their attention in the middle. At the end of our talk we can call them to action, inspire them or motivate them to learn more about the subject.</p>

<p>In less than 2 weeks from now the Women Techmakers Madrid will take place in Campus Madrid and there will be very interesting talks with very interesting women, that will become the model of a lot of women like me. And one of them is a 9 years old girl that I met today, very sweet but also brave!</p>
