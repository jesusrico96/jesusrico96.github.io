<p>After doing my first 2 personal websites, I wanted to put them together in a web page. Then, people in my company talked about GitHub pages to host web pages and I thought that it would be a good idea to learn more about it.</p>

<p>To host my second web page, I used GitHub pages using this tutorial: <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/">A guide to using Github pages</a>. It was so easy to do it that I wanted to learn Jekyll and create a blog using GitHub pages again.</p>

<p>For this web page I used this tutorial: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages</a>, also very simple to set up.</p>

<p>I have another blog about learning languages using Wordpress, <a href="https://9vidastieneungato.wordpress.com/">9 lives has a cat*</a>, maybe I migrate it to Jekyll blog near in the future!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note: In Spain a cat has 7 lives, in English speaking world use to have 9, why? It lost 2 lives while translating?</li>
</ul>
