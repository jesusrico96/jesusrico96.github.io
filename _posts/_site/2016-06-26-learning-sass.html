<p>I am starting the learning process with Sass and I have decided to apply the concepts after learning PostCSS, automating the compilation to css with Gulp.</p>

<p>I have learnt the basis with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sass">Learn Sass - Codecademy</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unit 1. Create a Sass stylesheet: It explains the compilation process, nesting selectors and variables.</li>
  <li>Unit 2. Mixins and the &amp; selector: The &amp; selector in nesting, mixins and mixins with arguments and string interpolation for mixins.</li>
  <li>Unit 3. Functions and operators: Arithmetic and color functions, each-loop, for-loop and conditional.</li>
  <li>Unit 4. Sustainable SCSS: Structure, @import, organize with partials, @extend, placeholders and @extend vs @mixin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this course is a good method to learn about Sass, but you need to apply it in real projects to retain the concepts.</p>

<p>I have also read an article for best practices: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/8-tips-help-get-best-sass/">8 Tips to Help You Get the Best out of Sass</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structure your Sass: Use a correct structure, use partials.</li>
  <li>Use Sass variables more effectively: Variables for colors and then variables to use the colors in the scss file (link-primary or primary-color).</li>
  <li>Reduce mixin usage: Including a mixin is the same as copying and pasting the styles throughout the CSS file. Use it only if an argument is present.</li>
  <li>Embrace placeholders: Placeholders can be used multiple times without adding any duplicate code.</li>
  <li>Use functions for calculations</li>
  <li>Order your work</li>
  <li>Limit Nesting: Never go more then 3 levels deep, ensure the CSS output is clean and reusable and use nesting when it makes sense to, not as a default option.</li>
  <li>Keep things simple: The purpose of Sass is to write cleaner more manageable CSS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have any recommendations to learn more about Sass?</p>
