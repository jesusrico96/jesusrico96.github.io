title: Applying what you learn
date: 2016-12-03

One day you decide you want to improve in what you do for a living. You start thinking about what you want to learn and you organize your <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban" alt="Kanban front-end development">learning program</a> in a visual way. 

You need a little guidance to keep going and you find it in a talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8_9F_nh6-I" alt="talk about CSS"> writing maintainable and scalable CSS</a>.

You know you need to apply the concepts you are going to learn in a web page and you think about where to publish it. Maybe you can use GitHub Pages to show the code and the result at the same time.

So now you have your side project! You will build a web page with resources to learn front-end development with:

- Gulp with Sass + autoprefixer

- CSS: Flexbox, BEM, CSS Variables 

Wish me luck!
