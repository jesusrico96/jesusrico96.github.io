Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Enough with the Lorem Ipsum. After tinkering with several options and tutorials, I finally got the thing online. Nice.
