After organizing the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">learning Front-end development project</a>, I am going to start learning about Preprocessors (Sass for CSS and Jade or HAML for HTML), Postprocessors (PostCSS) and automatic workflow (with Gulp or Grunt):

After learning this block I will apply the new concepts creating a web design, uploading the code in GitHub and sharing the results in the blog. 

Do you know free online resources for all of this? Right now I am focus on the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-sass">Learn Sass course</a> from Codecademy, but I will add all the resources in the Taiga Kanban and in the blog while I am learning. 

Wish me luck :)
