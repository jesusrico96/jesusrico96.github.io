After organizing a little and analyze what I want to learn to improve in Front-end development, it comes a question to my mind: How to get time for this? This learning process is like a side project, so I have researched in Internet to get some ideas.

    - Avoid distractions: find time to work in the project when there are no distractions.
    - Create consistency in your weekly calender: create a "Learning evening".
    - Be a passenger: use commute to learn something.
    - Learn to say no to things that you don't really want to: priorization is the key to success.

    - The time you set aside to work on your side project has to come from somewhere: less TV, less time for hobbies, ...
    - Get up an hour earlier
    - Put it in your calendar: or in my case in the kanban board
    - Make it regular: I can choose 2 days in the week to do the side project, the same as I go to pilates twice a week.
    - Make a commitment: I spoke about the talk I submitted to a group of people, so I have a deadline for the project.
