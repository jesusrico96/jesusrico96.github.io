After one year as a Front-end developer I want to improve the way I work, learning new and better techniques of doing responsive web design. That's why I'm starting a learning project. I have created a <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">Kanban</a> to organize myself and I will write the process in my <a href="http://cristinafsanz.github.io/projects/blog/">blog</a>. All the resources that I use in the project will be available in GitHub in a collaborative site.

Thanks to Twitter, I have found some great illustrators as <a href="https://twitter.com/frannerd">Frannerd</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/WheresMyBubble">Debbie Tung</a>. I have realized that Comic is a creative and powerful way to tell a story and I want to explore it. I will learn the basics of illustration and comics by myself and incorporate this medium in my blog. For that, I will start with the free online comic course <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/comics-art-in-relationship-ii/info">Comics: Art in relationship</a> in September. Meanwhile I will try doing some comics, painting them with watercolors and adding the texts and captions in Inkscape, after the inspiration of the Youtube tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofj9w31npF4">Watercolor comics by Wren</a> from <a href="http://wrensart.blogspot.com.es/">Wren Nowan</a>. I will add the resources that I find in my illustration journey in another Kanban <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-resources-learning-illustration/kanban">illustration resources</a>.
