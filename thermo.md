__Welcome to the Thermodynamics Learning Hub!__

If you have reached this corner of the Internet, it is very likely that you have, at least, a mild interest in things that spin, things that get really hot or things that go kaboom. Be it as it may, this place will have you served! I intend to use this section as a dedicated repository of educational resources, designed to support and enhance your understanding of thermodynamics. And also as my stash of little documents I'm pretty proud of. And maybe some documents I'm not so proud, but are mine nevertheless and I love them for that. 

Enjoy the chaos and don't forget to be awesome!
