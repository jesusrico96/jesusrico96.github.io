title: About me 
---

I am currently a Postdoc Researcher at the [Transport Processes Lab at the TU Dortmund University](https://tp.bci.tu-dortmund.de/). My field of study is combustion and pyrolysis kinetics, with a focus on experimental work and data processing.
I completed my PhD at the [University of Vigo](http://uvigo.gal), supervised by [Prof. David Patiño](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6129-8678) and [Prof. Raquel Pérez-Orozco](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6352-8959) and I have authored several [scientific contributions](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eB0Gb3EAAAAJ&hl=es) in the field of assessment and reduction of pollutants in the combustion of solid biomass, and more recently moved to the field of pyrolysis.
