  <h1>Organizing a learning process</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>When I saw that the <a href="https://www.koliseo.com/codemotion/codemotion-madrid/r4p/5753906952929280/#/">Call for papers for Codemotion Madrid 2016</a> process was open, I thought that I could explain my journey to becoming a Front-end developer because it can be useful for others.</p>

<p>As a said in another posts, I am Front-end developer since March last year, but I know that I have to improve a lot. Because of that, I thought that implementing a learning process can help me and others in the same situation improving in this field. The Codemotion conference is in November, so I have 5 months ahead to organize myself, keep improving and show the results there (and here in my blog). If my talk is not chosen, I can still explain this in other meetups or conferences that can be interested in this organization plan and I will also improve my skills in between, so I can’t lose.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-tools">Organizing tools</h2>

<p>I use 2 types of calendar that I add to a physical board. The first is the usual one, where I write down the meetups/meetings/free time stuff/trips, etc. With this first calendar I can see when I have time to learn. In the second one I write down the things that I would like to accomplished by month.</p>

<p><img src="../images/blog/calendars.png" alt="Calendars to organize" /></p>

<p>The bad thing about the second board is that I don’t usually know how many tasks I will accomplish in a month and I would like to reorganize order of tasks in a visual way.</p>

<p>For that, I am going to start using Kanban with the open source tool &lt;a href=”https://taiga.io/”Taiga&lt;/a&gt;. In the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">learning Front-end development project</a> I will add each task that I would like to accomplish in a user story. In the first version I am adding all the tasks, ideas and resources in the TO-DO column, I don’t know if I will separate them in some way to distinguish which kind of task is.</p>

<p>The organization in the Kanban board is the usual for this method, that is, columns TO-DO, DOING and DONE. However, I have added a ADD-TO-BLOG column to write a little explanation, example or conclusion in the blog after finishing doing each task. This way, other people can take advantage of the time inverted there.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-tasks">Organizing tasks</h2>

<p>I use Evernote to write about each task that I do, make list of things that I need to do to accomplish it or steps that I will use in the future again (for example, steps to upload a new blog post to GitHub). After finishing each task, I can get the important parts from there and adding them to the blog.</p>

<h2 id="improving-front-end-development-tasks">Improving front-end development tasks</h2>

<p>These are the tasks for this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tasks: HTML, CSS &amp; JS, Sass, PostCSS, Flexbox, responsive web design, best practices, workflow front-end development, accesibility, Material Design, UX</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resources: Free books to learn web design, articles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideas: Apply learning with personal projects, go to meetups/conferences, follow people that are where you want to be in front-end development</p>
  </li>
</ul>
