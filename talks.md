# Fantastic tricks and where to find them

I have done the "Fantastic tricks and where to find them" talk in 2 conferences, <a href="https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2017/programa/trucos-fantasticos-donde-encontrarlos/">T3chfest</a> and <a href="http://wtm.gdgmadrid.es/agenda/cristina-fernandez-trucosfantasticos.html">Women Techmakers Madrid</a>.

In this talk I wanted to share some resources to start as a front-end developer, although a lot of them can be used in other fields as well.

I mix the Harry Potter universe and the front-end development world and I enumerate some tricks to learn:

- Learn the basics and good practices.

- Add some tools to help your daily work.

- Organize yourself.

- Go to conferences and meetups. Do some courses and workshops. Read articles. Listen to podcasts. Inspire yourself with websites.

- Practice while you learn, code in Codepen or GitHub Pages to share your work anywhere.

- Don't try to learn everything at once and look for companies that help with learning.

# The importance of being involved in the programmer community

I started to be more involved in the programmer community since I when to the first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Ada-Code-Group/">Ada Code Group meetup</a> in Madrid. I realized we are few women in technology, but we are more than we think and we do a lot of interesting stuff that need to be shared.

I wanted to share my experience of getting involved in the community with a group of female programmers inside the <a href="http://adalab.es/">Adalab</a> program. I spoke about:

- Going to conferences and meetups.

- Knowing other developers with Twitter.

- Doing my first talk.
